# PharmaAnalysis
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of pharmaceutical sales data, focusing on data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization. The objective was to transform raw data into a structured format, enabling accurate reporting and insightful decision-making.

Key Tasks & Deliverables
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
Normalized the dataset to optimize storage and ensure data integrity.
Data Analysis & Insights

Identified key sales trends, top-performing products, and customer segments.
Analyzed sales distribution by country, distributor, and sales team.
Examined the price-sales relationship and its impact on revenue.
Dashboard & Report Development

Created an interactive Power BI dashboard for executive-level insights.
Implemented a filter panel toggle to enhance usability.
Added an info button to guide users on dashboard navigation (inspired by Sushree Sangeeta Jena's dashboard).
Designed a detailed report summarizing key findings and performance metrics.
Key Insights from the Analysis
Total sales amounted to $23.6B, with Pharmacy (Retail) being the top channel.
Germany accounted for 94.23% of total sales, while Poland contributed 5.77%.
Ionclotide was the top-selling product, generating $338M in sales.
Delta Team led the sales force, contributing 30.81% of total revenue.
No correlation between price and sales, confirming that pharmaceutical products are not price-sensitive.
